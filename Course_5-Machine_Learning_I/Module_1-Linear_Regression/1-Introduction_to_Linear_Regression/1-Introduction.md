# Introduction

Welcome to the module on Linear Regression!

In the first module of the program, **Introduction to Machine Learning**, you understood what machine learning is and its role in everyday life. You also learnt about the two broad categories of machine learning, which are supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning, as the name suggests, is a type of learning in which you have data that clearly specifies the input and corresponding output. On the other hand, in unsupervised learning, there is no clearly defined input and output. You try to form insights from the data at hand. 

After understanding this, you also looked at a few important classes of machine learning algorithms under **supervised and unsupervised learning**. You have now understood that if you are looking to predict a continuous value, you use a regression algorithm. On the other hand, if you are looking to predict a discrete value, you use a classification algorithm. For a quick refresher around this concept, you can refer to the Supervised Learning Algorithms segment in the Introduction to Machine Learning module.

Question 1/2

Mandatory

#### Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

Qn: Identify the type of problem here: Consider a large data set of the medical profiles of cancer patients with no labels. The model has to learn whether there are different groups of such patients for whom separate treatments may be tailored.

- Supervised learning

- Unsupervised learning

Ans: B. *This can be addressed using an unsupervised learning algorithm, in which you group patients into different clusters.*

Qn: Identify the type of problem here: You have the past data on the performance of two cricket teams, based on different parameters and the match results. You have to predict which team will win.

- Supervised learning

- Unsupervised learning

Ans: A. *You have the data of the past few years to train your model on. As you know the results of different games based on different performance parameters, it will be a supervised learning problem, more specifically, a classification problem, as your output variable (i.e., the name of the team) is categorical.*

Now that we have done a quick revision of the basics of machine learning, let’s deep dive into one of the algorithms to start your modelling process with Linear Regression. Linear regression belongs to the class of regression algorithms; this module will help you get an in-depth understanding of the algorithm and build practical expertise in applying the algorithm in a given scenario. In the following video, Jaidev will give you a quick introduction to the module.
