# Summary

Let’s summarise what you learnt:

1.  It is important to understand if a linear regression modelling will be applicable to the problem you are trying to solve. For example, linear regression cannot help you decide if a customer will opt out of a subscription, as this is a classification problem.
2.  Linear regression guarantees interpolation but not extrapolation.
3.  While linear regression can be used for both projection and prediction, there is a difference between the two. In prediction, the goal is to identify the most important variables that explain the outcome in a simpler way. In projection, the goal is to accurately forecast the outcome, no matter how complex the model gets.
4.  The business goal is crucial and will decide what path the modelling process should take.
5.  In the industry, variables that are actionable are valued over others. For example, given two quite similar variables, “Views to the platform” and “Visitors to the platform”, the latter is more actionable, as it is easier to get viewers to the platform than forcing anybody to watch the shows.
6.  You don’t end the modelling process until you are sure that no more significant variables could be added to explain the outcome. Thus, you check for randomness of errors, which could indicate whether any KPI that could have helped explain the outcome was left out.//span
