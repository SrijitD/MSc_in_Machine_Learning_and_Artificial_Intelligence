# Summary

This session introduced you to the basic building block of linear algebra.

First, you saw two views of vectors - as arrays and as arrows - and the manner in which different properties reflect across both these views.  You then proceeded to work on some vector operations - addition, scalar multiplication, and dot products. You saw how the **dot product** can be used to compute the **angle between two vectors**. As an example, you used the dot product to compute the **angles between emails** and saw that emails similar to each other have a smaller angle between them. 

You also studied that there is a choice for the **basis vectors** (which are usually chosen to be ^i,^j,^k in 3d space). The **linear combination** of vectors is computed by scaling the vectors by arbitrary scalars and adding them.

The set of all possible vectors you can get in this manner is called the **span of the vectors.** In the special case when some of the vectors happen to lie in the span of the other vectors, i.e. some vectors can be expressed as linear combination of the others, they are called **linearly dependent** vectors. In case none of the vectors lies in the span of the others, the vectors are called **linearly independent.**

In the next session, you will learn to rethink the idea of the basis vectors from scratch, and thus understand the concept of **linear transformations.**
